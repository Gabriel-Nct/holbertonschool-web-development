# HTML Structure Project

> A pixel-perfect implementation of a designer mockup using pure semantic HTML

## Project Overview

## Learning Objectives

- Master semantic HTML5 elements
- Understand proper document structure
- Implement accessibility best practices
- Translate visual designs into logical HTML hierarchy
- Prepare a solid foundation for CSS styling
