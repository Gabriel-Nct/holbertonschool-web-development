# CSS Advanced

This project focuses on implementing advanced CSS styling techniques to create a polished, professional webpage. Building upon the HTML foundation from the previous project, this repository demonstrates modern CSS practices, specificity management, and responsive design principles.

## Project Overview

This project is a continuation of the `HTML, advanced` project, where we now apply sophisticated CSS styling to transform a basic HTML structure into a visually appealing and fully functional webpage. The design follows a provided Figma mockup with pixel-perfect precision.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General CSS Concepts
- **What is CSS**: Understanding Cascading Style Sheets and their role in web development
- **How to add style to an element**: Various methods of applying CSS (inline, internal, external)
- **What is a class**: CSS class selectors and their implementation
- **What is a selector**: Different types of CSS selectors and their usage
- **How to compute CSS Specificity Value**: Understanding the specificity hierarchy and calculation
- **What are Box properties in CSS**: The CSS box model and its components
- **How does the browser load a webpage**: The rendering process and CSS parsing
